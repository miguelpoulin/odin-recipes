            This is not a drill, this chicken is so <em>fire</em>, that it will burn
            down your house! If you forgetting to close the oven doesn't do it before... 
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 (5 ounce) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
            <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 medium orange, zested</li>
            <li>⅔ cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon caraway seeds</li>
            <li>1 splash water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Generously season chicken thighs on both sides with 2 teaspoons kosher 
                salt.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large cast iron skillet over high heat. Add chicken, 
                skin-side down, to the hot oil and sear until skin is golden brown and 
                releases from the bottom of the skillet, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and sear on 
                the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and remove chicken 
                to a plate. Drain fat from the skillet and reserve for another use.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place the skillet back on the stove. Add onion, a pinch of kosher salt, 
                and sugar. Turn heat to medium-high; cook and stir until onion turns 
                translucent and sugar starts to caramelize on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. 
                Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds, being careful 
                not to burn.</li>
            <li>Add orange zest, orange juice, lemon juice, and chicken broth. Increase 
                heat to high, and stir in cinnamon, cayenne, and black pepper. Stir 
                occasionally and bring to a boil. Boil until liquids are reduced by half, 
                2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and transfer chicken and any accumulated juices back 
                into the skillet; make sure the skin is facing up. Baste chicken with the 
                liquid and sprinkle caraway seeds over top.</li>
            <li>Cover and bake in the center of the preheated oven for 1 hour. Remove 
                from the oven, remove the lid, and baste chicken.</li>
            <li>Return to the oven and bake, uncovered, until no longer pink at the 
                bone and the juices run clear, about 20 more minutes, adding a splash of 
                water if the liquid dries out. An instant-read thermometer inserted near 
                the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and baste again. Garnish with grated orange zest and 
                serve.</li>
        </ol>
